# Internationalization

Different locations around the world use different languages, and different ways of formatting dates, times, and currency.

I've taken the first step and let you enter start and end dates for your event using your browser's localization features,
and this includes selecting a date using a calendar. This depends on your using a modern browser. Safari on older Macs may be problematic.

Dates and times will be formatted using the locale of your studio. If you have events that span different locales, I can create
additional studios for you so that you can control which locale settings are used by requesting new events in the
studio that matches the locale you desire. I can also override locales for your studio based on your preferences - for example parts of Canada prefer French, others prefer English.

Prices and invoices will show local currency, so you will see values like $400.00 in US and Â¥60,000 in Japan.

PDFs produced for studios in North America will be formatted for letter size pages, everywhere else will be formatted for A4 size pages.

I'd like to do more. If you have ideas, let me know.

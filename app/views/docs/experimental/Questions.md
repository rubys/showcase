# Questions

The Questions feature allows event organizers to collect additional information from participants beyond basic registration. This is useful for gathering choices like meal preferences, dietary restrictions, hotel options, or any other custom information.

## Setup

Questions are associated with **options** (billable items like meals, hotels, workshops, etc.). To add questions:

1. Go to the **Settings** page
2. Navigate to the **Prices** tab
3. Find or create an option (e.g., "Friday Dinner")
4. Click **Edit** on the option
5. Scroll to the **Questions for this option** section
6. Click **Add Question** to create a new question

### Question Types

Two types of questions are supported:

* **Radio Buttons** - For multiple choice questions (e.g., meal choice: beef, chicken, fish, vegetarian)
  * Enter each choice on a separate line
  * Participants can select one option
  * Click a selected radio button again to deselect it (return to "no answer")

* **Text Area** - For free-form text responses (e.g., dietary restrictions, special requests)
  * Participants can enter any text

### Managing Questions

* **Add/Remove Questions** - Use the "Add Question" button to add more questions. Click "Remove Question" to delete.
* **Reorder Questions** - Questions appear in the order they are listed
* **Edit Questions** - You can edit question text and choices at any time
  * Changes to question/choice text will be reflected in summaries and reports
  * Removing a choice will clear any answers that previously selected that choice
  * You cannot change question type (radio ↔ textarea) after answers exist

## Collecting Answers

Questions automatically appear on person forms when editing students or guests:

1. Navigate to a **Studio** page
2. Click on a **person** to edit them
3. Select a **package** and/or **options**
4. Questions from selected options will appear dynamically at the bottom of the form
5. Participants (or organizers on their behalf) fill in the answers
6. Click **Update** to save

**Note:** Answers can be left blank. The system tracks who has not yet provided an answer.

Once participants have answered questions, you can view and export the results:

## Tips

* Add questions before participants register to avoid follow-up
* Review answers regularly to track completion rates

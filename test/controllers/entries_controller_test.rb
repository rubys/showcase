# Comprehensive tests for EntriesController which manages ballroom dance entry creation,
# validation, and modification workflows. This controller is critical for:
#
# - Entry creation with complex partnership validation
# - Dance limit enforcement per student
# - Entry merging logic for duplicate handling
# - Pro-Am vs Amateur vs Professional entry management
# - Package assignment and billing integration
# - Heat creation and management during entry processing
# - Solo entry handling with formation management
#
# Tests cover:
# - CRUD operations with business rule validation
# - Dance limit enforcement scenarios
# - Entry merging and deduplication logic
# - Partnership type handling (Pro-Am, Amateur, Professional)
# - Package assignment integration
# - Error handling and edge cases
# - Transaction safety and data integrity

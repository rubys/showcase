## Existing Info-Box Issues

### Issues Requiring Updates

1. **people/backs.html.erb** - Too minimal
   - *Current:* "At the bottom of this page is a form..."
   - *Add:* Explanation of back number purpose, assignment strategy, printing

2. **scores/multis.html.erb** - Too minimal
   - *Current:* "Click on a heat name..."
   - *Add:* Scrutineering explanation, callback system, score interpretation

3. **scores/callbacks.html.erb** - Missing calculation info
   - *Current:* Only explains highlighting
   - *Add:* How callbacks are calculated, rules, thresholds

4. **scores/by_level.html.erb** - Too minimal
   - *Current:* "Click on Followers or Leaders..."
   - *Add:* Scoring aggregation methodology, level comparison

5. **scores/by_age.html.erb** - Too minimal
   - *Current:* "Click on Followers or Leaders..."
   - *Add:* Age category scoring, cross-age comparisons

6. **event/publish.html.erb** - Missing features

## Implementation Pattern

### Standard Info-Box Structure
```erb
<div data-controller="info-box">
  <div class="info-button">&#x24D8;</div>
  <ul class="info-box">
    <li>First important point</li>
    <li>Second important point with <%= link_to 'helpful link', some_path %></li>
    <li class="text-red-600">‚ö†Ô∏è Important warning about destructive actions</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

### Conditional Info-Box (shown by default)
```erb
<div data-controller="info-box">
  <div class="info-button">&#x24D8;</div>
  <ul class="info-box" style="display: block;">
    <li>Critical information shown by default</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

### Reusable Partial Pattern
```erb
<!-- In _info_box.html.erb partial -->
<div data-controller="info-box">
  <div class="info-button">&#x24D8;</div>
  <ul class="info-box">
    <% if @context == 'students' %>
      <li>Student-specific guidance</li>
    <% elsif @context == 'judges' %>
      <li>Judge-specific guidance</li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- In view that uses it -->
<%= render 'shared/info_box', context: 'students' %>
```

## Success Metrics

**Current State:**
- Info-box coverage: 52/283 pages (18%)
- Quality issues: 5 minimal, 2 duplicates, 3 missing features

**Target State (After All Phases):**
- Info-box coverage: 82/283 pages (29%)
  - All high-priority pages: 15 new + 5 fixes
  - All medium-priority pages: 10 new
  - Quality improvements: 3 enhancements + 2 consolidations
- Zero minimal/incomplete info-boxes
- All navigation hubs have guidance
- All complex workflows documented

---

## Conclusion

The showcase application has a **solid foundation** of info-box implementations. The existing 52 info-boxes are generally well-written and helpful. The main gaps are:

1. **Navigation hubs** (studios, summary, entries) lack guidance
2. **Scoring pages** need expansion and public-facing explanation
3. **Complex workflows** (entries, table assignments, formations) need more context
4. **5 existing info-boxes** are too minimal and need expansion

The recommended phased approach prioritizes:
- **Phase 1-2:** Fix existing issues + add to core hubs (9 pages)
- **Phase 3-4:** Complex workflows + public pages (7 pages)
- **Phase 5-6:** Enhancements + nice-to-haves (16 pages)

**Total effort:** 32 pages to achieve comprehensive coverage of all user-facing features.

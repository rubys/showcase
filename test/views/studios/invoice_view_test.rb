# Comprehensive tests for invoice view rendering.
# These tests verify that the invoice partials correctly filter and display
# data based on invoice type (studio, student, instructor).
#
# Tests cover:
# - Student invoice filtering (excludes professionals)
# - Instructor invoice filtering (excludes non-invoice_to people)
# - Studio invoice display (shows all people)
# - Correct total calculations based on filtered people
# - Entry detail display (combo dances, pro solo levels, splitting)

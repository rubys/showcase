# Scratches and Walk Ons

Things always come up at the last minute which will require changes after you've gone to print.

Even if you've clicked the lock button on agenda page once you have gone to print (and it is highly recommended that you do so), you can continue to add and remove entries, either by editing entries or individual heats.  See [Changing Entries](./Entries#changing-entries) for more information.

The key difference is that you will **not** want to click on redo on either the heats or agenda page as that will change the schedule.  Instead you will find that new entries are assigned to heat zero.

Instead of clicking redo, a Schedule button will appear under all of the unscheduled entries.
Clicking on this button will attempt to add these entries to existing heats.  It may not be
possible to schedule all of the heats in this way.

You can also control where the entries are placed by hovering over an entry, click on Edit,
changing the heat number and clicking on Update Heat.  Additional options can be found in
[Reordering](./Reordering).

Judges, Emcees, DJs and participants using the mobile application will see the live version of the schedule.  For example, if there is a scratch the Emcee will see "5 couples on the floor" if there previously were 6.

## Cleaning Scratched Heats

When heats are scratched (removed), they are marked with a negative heat number and kept in the database. This allows them to be restored if needed. If you want to permanently remove all scratched heats without affecting the rest of the schedule, you can use the **Clean** button that appears on the heats page when there are scratched heats present.

The Clean button will only appear when:
- There is at least one scratched heat (heat number < 0)
- The event is unlocked

Clicking Clean will permanently delete all scratched heats and any orphaned entries. This action cannot be undone, so you will be prompted to confirm before proceeding.

# Reordering

While the redo button is labor savor, you may have unique requirements that can't be handled automatically.  Perhaps you want to order/combine multi events.  Or perhaps an student isn't
available for a portion of a day.

Note: [solos](./Solos) are handled differently.  Order solos by going to the Heats page, clicking the Solos button, and using drag and drop to rearrange the order.

The first thing you will need to do is to either lock the entire agenda or lock an individual agenda item.  This will prevent the redo button from undoing the changes you are about to make.

To lock the entire agenda, click the lock icon at the top of either the agenda or heats page.

To lock an individual agenda item, go to the heats page.  Click on the item in the agenda at the top or scroll to the agenda item later in the page.  Hover over the agenda item name and a lock icon will appear.  Click on it.

A few things to note if you lock an individual agenda item and then click redo:

  * Redoing the entire agenda will may result in new heat numbers for this agenda item but the
    order of heats in the agenda, and the list of couples in each heat will be preserved.
  * If new entries are added for dances in this agenda item, redo will *not* add the new entries
    to existing heats.  See [Scratches and Walk Ons](./Scratches-and-Walk-ons) for information
    on how you can schedule these heats.
  * Scratches will be removed, even from locked agenda items.

## Reordering heats

The easiest way to reorder heats that are close together is with drag and drop.  Look for the word Heat at the beginning of a line.  Grab it, and drag it to where you want that heat to be.  Drop it, and the heats will be renumbered automatically.

If the heats are further apart this may be inconvenient.  Another method that achieves the same result
is to click on the heat number itself.  This will replace the heat number with an input field and you can change the number.  If there is an existing heat with that number, the heats will be renumbered as before.  You can also asign a new number (for example, by adding a decimal like "500.1") and that heat will be moved to be in between other heats.

If there are gaps or decimals, a renumber button will appear at the top of the page.  You won't want to use this after you go to print, but it may be handy up until that point.

## Moving couples to another heat

Once again, if the heats are close enough together, the easiest way to move a couple is via drag and drop.  Hover over some whitespace in the line containing the couple to be moved and the background for that line will turn yellow.  Drag and drop the couple to the desired heat.

If the heats are further apart, when you hover over the line containing the couple you want to move an
edit button will appear on the far left.  Click on it and you can change the heat number.  It is also
possible to change the dance partner and other information about this entry.  Click on Update Heat when
done.

If the result of this changes has one dancer on the floor multiple times, that name will be shown with
a red background.  Continue editing or moving entries to resolve this issue.

## Combining two heats

It is possible to drag and drop (or edit heat numbers) on each couple in a heat to move them to
another heat, resulting in one less heat.

Note that the combined heat may contain more couples than the settings would ordinarily allow, or
may even contain couples dancing different dances.  This may be useful for specialty dances
(perhaps put west coast and hustle together), or for multi heats (you may have split by age
category or level, resulting in some heats with few couples).

## Splitting a heat

While not common, it is possible to split a heat.  Hover over a couple that you wish to move to a new
heat and click the edit button.  Change the heat number to a number that isn't currently in use - 
generally this is done by adding a decimal like ".1" to the existing heat number.  Click Update Heat when done.

Now you can drag and drop additional couples to the new heat.

Once complete the new heat can be moved to the desired location.

If these changes are done before you have gone to print, scroll to the top and a on the right you
will see a renumber button.  This will make all heat numbers whole numbers.

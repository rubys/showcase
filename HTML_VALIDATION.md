# HTML Template Validation Project

## Overview
A comprehensive HTML validation effort is underway to fix structural issues across all ERB templates. A custom ERB-aware validator has been created to identify and fix unclosed tags, mismatched elements, and improper nesting.

## Validation Tool
```bash
# Run the smart ERB-aware HTML validator
ruby bin/validate_html

# The validator is located at lib/html_validator.rb and provides:
# - Context-aware ERB parsing (handles if/else blocks, loops, etc.)
# - Accurate detection of unclosed/mismatched HTML tags
# - Current success rate: 54.7% (122/223 clean files)
```

## Progress Status
**High Priority Files (10+ issues) - COMPLETED:**
- ✅ app/views/admin/apply.html.erb (20→0 issues)
- ✅ app/views/scores/heat.html.erb (19→0 issues)
- ✅ app/views/scores/_by_studio.html.erb (18→0 issues)
- ✅ app/views/people/staff.html.erb (17→0 issues)
- ✅ app/views/solos/djlist.html.erb (14→0 issues)
- ✅ app/views/people/index.html.erb (14→0 issues)
- ✅ app/views/studios/_invoice.html.erb (12→0 issues)
- ✅ app/views/heats/index.html.erb (12→0 issues)
- ✅ app/views/people/couples.html.erb (11→0 issues)

**Common Issues Fixed:**
1. Unclosed `<li>` tags in info boxes
2. Unclosed `<th>` and `<td>` tags in tables
3. Mismatched heading tags (e.g., `<h2>` closed with `</h1>`)
4. Missing closing `</tr>` tags in table headers
5. Orphaned closing tags

## Next Steps to Resume
1. Run `ruby bin/validate_html` to see current status
2. Focus on MEDIUM priority files (5-9 issues each)
3. Then tackle LOW priority files (1-4 issues each)
4. Consider implementing HTML validation in CI/CD pipeline
5. Document HTML coding standards for the project

## Tips for Continuing
- The validator may show false positives for complex ERB structures
- Always verify actual structural issues before making changes
- Focus on clear issues like unclosed tags and mismatched elements
- Test thoroughly after fixes - all 645 tests should pass
